## Author: Grace Sigalla

## Introduction
This HCUP project was conducted to determine the different social health determinants of influenza and influenza like diseases in the state of New York, for the years 2017 and 2018, for emergency room visits as well as inpatients.

The data was cleaned and analyzed was using R programming and tools such as STATA. During the data cleaning, new columns were formed in order to match column names with data merged from the census bureau and as well as zip-zcta crosswalk data. 

## Findings

From the analysis conducted, it is determined that there are more females, and nonhispanic white individuals with the most attendance for both inpatient and emergency department visits. However, for the inpatient visits, it is seen that mostly observed to be individuals of age 65 and above. As for emergency department visits, it is observed to be mostly individuals in the age range of 0-64, with a peak of those in the 30's. Moreover, mostly those who live in adjacent (urban) areas, have the most inpatient and emergency room visits. Most of the visits had a higher peak during the cold seasons, such as January and December. All this analysis was conducted partly to look at inpatient and emergency department visits that are associated to influenza and influenza like diseases such as bronchitis and pneumonea.

## Future work

There is still a lot of potential to do future work such as determining the hospitalizations and emergency room visits per county, per hospital, and also looking at reasons why is it mostly females with higher attendance compared to men. Also, more importantly, looking at the relatinship between the trends in influenza and influenza like visits, along with those related to COVID-19.
